I planned to return to complete loan documents after my birthday but the finance rep XXXX insisted I complete the loan process that day. I was advised that I could change my date of birth to XXXX to make myself older and apply for the loans on my own since my parents were unwilling to assume a loan under their names/credit. I was under the age of XXXX when I signed for all school documents. I was taken advantage of and manipulated. I have been dealing with these insurmountable loans since then. I did not find work in the field I attended school for ; due to the fact that I could not survive and pay these loans back with the minimum wage jobs available to me in the culinary field. I recently went to the school to pick up loan document ( I had to hurry because the campus is now closed ) copies but was only provided with enrollment paperwork ( which does n't include loan application details ). I have tried to take responsibility for this debt but have come to the conclusion that I need to speak out. I have given this information to different reps which answer phones at the loan companies. I have contacted lawyers but could not afford to hire onXXXX. I know the school has been sued in the past for their shady business practices. They have lost lawsuits paid out thousands upon thousands in damages to the victims. I am unfortunately one of the ones that is still suffering with the burden of debt. The answers I have received from account reps are well you lied so too bad you still owe this money. I was not of age of consent and was taken advantage of by people that were desperate to sell a loan.
